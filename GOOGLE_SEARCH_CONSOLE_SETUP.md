# Google Search Console Setup Guide

## Why This is Critical for SEO (100% FREE)

Google Search Console is the **#1 most important free SEO tool**. It shows you:

- What keywords people use to find your site
- How many people see your site in search results
- Which pages rank well (and which don't)
- Technical issues that prevent ranking
- Index coverage and errors

**Without Search Console, you're flying blind!**

## Step-by-Step Setup (15 minutes)

### 1. Sign Up for Google Search Console

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console/
2. Click "Start Now"
3. Sign in with your Google account (create one if needed)

### 2. Add Your Property

You'll see two options - choose **"URL prefix"**:

```
URL prefix: https://smiletrustclinic.com
```

Click "Continue"

### 3. Verify Ownership

Google will ask you to verify you own the website. For Next.js/Vercel:

**Option A: HTML Tag (Easiest for Next.js)**

1. Google will give you a meta tag like:

```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
```

2. Add it to your Next.js layout file:

Open `src/app/layout.js` and add the verification meta tag inside the `<head>` section:

```javascript
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        {/* Add Google Search Console verification here */}
        <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />

        {/* ... rest of your head tags ... */}
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

3. Deploy your changes to production
4. Go back to Search Console and click "Verify"

**Option B: Vercel DNS (Alternative)**

If you use Vercel for hosting:

1. Choose "DNS record" verification
2. Add the TXT record to your domain settings in Vercel
3. Wait a few minutes and verify

### 4. Submit Your Sitemap

Once verified:

1. In Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
2. Enter your sitemap URL: `https://smiletrustclinic.com/sitemap.xml`
3. Click "Submit"

You should see a success message!

### 5. Wait for Data (Be Patient!)

- It takes 24-48 hours for data to start appearing
- Full data may take 1-2 weeks
- Check back regularly to monitor progress
