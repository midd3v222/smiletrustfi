# SmileTrust SEO Action Plan - Zero Budget Strategy

## üéØ Goal: Rank for "dental clinic" searches organically without ads

---

## PHASE 1: QUICK WINS (Week 1-2) ‚ö°

### 1. Create Location-Specific Pages (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why**: People search for "dental clinics in [city]" - you need dedicated pages for each location.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create `/clinics/[city]` route in Next.js
- [ ] Build dynamic pages for each city you show clinics for:
  - Istanbul, Turkey
  - Antalya, Turkey
  - Izmir, Turkey
  - Cancun, Mexico
  - Mexico City, Mexico
  - Tijuana, Mexico
  - Bangkok, Thailand
  - Chiang Mai, Thailand
  - Budapest, Hungary
  - San Jose, Costa Rica

**Each page must include:**
```
- Title: "Best Dental Clinics in [City], [Country] | Verified Reviews & Prices"
- H1: "Top-Rated Dental Clinics in [City]"
- H2: "Why Choose [City] for Dental Care?"
- H2: "Top Dental Procedures in [City]"
- H2: "Compare Prices: [City] vs USA/UK/EU"
- Actual clinic listings from your database
- Average price comparisons
- Testimonials/reviews
- Local information (travel, accommodation)
```

### 2. Optimize URLs for SEO
**Current**: Your pages are good, but add more granular pages
**Add**:
- `/find-clinics-near-me`
- `/compare-dental-clinic-prices`
- `/veneers-cost-calculator`
- `/dental-tourism-guide`

### 3. Add FAQ Schema to All Pages
**Action**: Add structured data for FAQ sections on each page

Example for homepage:
```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do I find a reliable dental clinic?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Look for clinics with verified reviews, proper certifications, and transparent pricing..."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How much can I save with dental tourism?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Patients typically save 50-70% on dental procedures abroad..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Add Reviews/Testimonials with Schema
**Action**: Add Review schema markup to clinic listings

```javascript
{
  "@type": "Review",
  "reviewRating": {
    "@type": "Rating",
    "ratingValue": "5",
    "bestRating": "5"
  },
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Anonymous Patient"

  "reviewBody": "Great experience with my veneers..."
